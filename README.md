# AVR Sample Code
This repository contains code I wrote for my Embedded Intelligent Systems (CENG 347) course at SDMines. 

All of the code was written for an ATmega 2560 using the Arduino IDE and Sublime Text.

Each Lab folder contains a report further descibing the lab, as well as useful resources such as images or documents pertaining to it.
